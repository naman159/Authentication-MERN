# MERN-Authentication-Template
A template for MERN Authentication with JWT auth. A good starter project to understand how to implement a full stack login adn register page.
## Run it on your own Computer:
1. Clone the repository
2. cd into the location of the downloaded folder
3. Run the following commmand in cli
```
npm run dev
```
